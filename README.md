# Simple Calculator

A basic calculator built using **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript** as part of  
**The Odin Project – JavaScript Fundamentals (Final Assignment)**.

This project focuses on implementing calculator logic from scratch while reinforcing fundamental JavaScript concepts.

## What I Learned

- DOM manipulation using JavaScript
- Handling user input through event listeners
- Managing application state without frameworks
- Writing clean and reusable functions for arithmetic operations
- Dealing with edge cases (multiple operators, division by zero, chaining operations)

---

## Tech Stack

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (Vanilla)

No external libraries or frameworks were used.

## Project Context

This calculator was built as the **final assignment of the JavaScript Fundamentals section** in  
[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

The goal of the assignment was not visual design, but correct logic, clean code, and understanding how JavaScript works under the hood.

## Notes

This project is intentionally kept simple and framework-free to emphasize JavaScript fundamentals rather than abstraction layers.
